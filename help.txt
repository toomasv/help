Red []
{Example help text

===Section

Sections are started with `===` + section heading, followed by blank line.

---Subsection

Subsections are started with `---` + subsection heading, followed by blank line.

===Text

Text lines are continuously concatenated. 
To break a line, 
add two spaces in the end of it like this:  
- in this way  
- you can create  
- lists

Paragraphs are separated by blank line(s).

===Emphasis

For *bolding* use `*...*`,  
for /italics/ use `/.../`,  
for _underlining_ use `_..._`.

===Escaping

To escape special characters, use `\`.

Special characters are `\*/_<[^{`.

Also `!`, `===`, `---`, `<space>` and `<tab>` in beginning of line may need escaping.

Standard escape character for Red is `^^`, and it is used as usual here too.  
Especially, remember to use `\^^^{` if you want to escape starting-brace without matching closing-brace.

===Code

Code examples are included by indenting by any number of spaces or tabs:

 text "clicking executes"
 area "Examples assume VID layout"
   
	result: text ""
	do [repeat i 5 [append result/text i]]

Clicking on code executes it, assuming VID layout.  
You can alter code and play with it by ctrl-clicking on code.

Short inline code is included between backticks ``...``.  
Backticks themselves cannot be included in inline code except in the very beginning or in the very end, as in ```...```.

===Notes

Notes are included by starting line with !. E.g.  

`!Pay attention!`

will result in:

!Pay attention!

===Links

Format for links is `<link text>(link)`.

Links can be internal or external.

/Internal links/ link to help pages by refering to page name,  
like `[Text](Text)`: [Text](Text).

/External links/ of course refer to external pages,  
like `[Red](https://www.red-lang.org/)`: [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/).

===Colors

Text may be colored by declaring `{color}`. E.g. `{orange}` will result in {orange}orange color. 
This color will be used for text until you declare {black}new color.

Background color may be changed by `{#bg-color#}` {#yellow#}and background coloring ended by `{#}`{#}.

===Font

Font can be changed by `<"font-name" size>`. E.g. `<"Courier New" 12>` <"Courier New" 12>is 12 point "Courier New"<>.
Altered font application is ended by `<>`.

===Other

You might want to use â˜‘ or other extended chars sometimes.
